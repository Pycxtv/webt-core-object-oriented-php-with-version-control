# What VCS is?
Version Control Systems are a piece software to keep track of multiple versions of files. The most famous example, Git, uses a structure of commits, branches and repositories to achieve this. Commits are snapshots of the current state of the files, branches are different versions of the same repository and repositories are the containers for the files and their history.

If you want to learn more about Git, the [Git Pro Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), written by Ben Straub and Scott Chacon is a good resource.
